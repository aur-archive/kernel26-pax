Firefox does not seem to work in default configuration. Install "paxctl" from
AUR and deactivate PaX features for the firefox executable:

# Add a PT_PAX_FLAGS to the binary.
paxctl -C /usr/lib/firefox-4.0/firefox

# Deactivate MPROTECT and RANDMMAP.
paxctl -PSmXEr /usr/lib/firefox-4.0/firefox


The same applies to the chromium binary (which is located at
"/usr/lib/chromium/chromium").
